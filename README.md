# Next.js Project Starter

Welcome to the Next.js Project Starter repository! This repository is designed
to help you kickstart your Next.js projects with a solid foundation and best
practices in mind. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started
with Next.js, this starter code will save you time and help you build powerful
web applications efficiently.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Harness the power of Next.js, a popular React framework that
  offers server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other performance
  optimizations.

- **React**: Build your user interfaces using React, a widely-used JavaScript
  library for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

- **Routing**: Take advantage of Next.js's built-in routing system to create
  SEO-friendly, client-side navigation for your app.

- **Styled Components**: Use styled-components to style your components with
  ease and maintainable CSS-in-JS.

- **ESLint and Prettier**: Ensure code consistency and catch errors early with
  ESLint and Prettier configurations included.

- **Customizable Configuration**: Easily customize your project's configuration
  and add additional libraries or tools as needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this Next.js project starter in Visual Studio
Code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**: Next.js relies on Node.js.
   Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), which
   includes npm.

   To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal
   and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v

   ```

2. **Visual Studio Code**: You can download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from
   [code.visualstudio.com](code.visualstudio.com). It's a lightweight, highly
   customizable code editor with excellent support for JavaScript and React
   development.

After installing VS Code, you might want to consider installing some useful
extensions for web development, such as **"ESLint"** for code linting and
**"Prettier"** for code formatting. You can install extensions from the VS Code
marketplace.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Next.js project starter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   - Click the green `Use this template` button above.
   - Alternatively:

   ```bash
   npx degit emmanuelubachi/nextjs-simple-starter <project name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd <project name>
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpn install
   ```

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   ```bash

   ```

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
   the result.

   You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page
   auto-updates as you edit the file.

   This project uses
   [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to
   automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel
